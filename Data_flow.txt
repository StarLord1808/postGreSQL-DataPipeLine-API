**Data Flow: From Source to Final Layer**

## **1. Source Layer**
- **Source:** CSV file
- **Destination Database:** `hospital`
- **Schema:** `LANDING`
- **Process:**
  - CSV data is ingested into the `LANDING` schema of the `hospital` database.
  - Initial raw data validation and integrity checks are performed.
  - **Truncate Load:** The `LANDING` layer follows a truncate and reload strategy, meaning old data is completely removed before new data is loaded.

## **2. Transformation & Processing**
- **Intermediate Steps:**
  - Data cleansing, standardization, and deduplication.
  - Necessary transformations applied for consistency.
  - Data is prepared for Change Data Capture (CDC) implementation.

## **3. Change Data Capture (CDC) Logic**
- **Key Field:** `PATIENT_ID`
- **CDC Implementation:**
  - If `PATIENT_ID` already exists in the `FINAL_LAYER`, the record is updated by marking the previous record as inactive.
  - If `PATIENT_ID` is new, the record is inserted as a new entry.

## **4. Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) Type 2 Implementation**
- **Purpose:** Maintain a historical record of changes.
- **Steps:**
  - New changes result in an update to the existing record while keeping historical records.
  - Previous records are versioned with an `END_DATE` and marked inactive.
  - New records get a fresh `START_DATE` and remain active until an update occurs.

## **5. Final Layer**
- **Destination Database:** `core`
- **Schema:** `FINAL_LAYER`
- **Process:**
  - Transformed data is loaded into the `FINAL_LAYER` schema.
  - Maintains up-to-date and historical patient records using SCD Type 2.
  - Provides clean, structured, and versioned data for analytical and operational use.
